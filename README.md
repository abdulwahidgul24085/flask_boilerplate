## Flask Boilerplate
The idea of the project is provide you a base from where to start your flask project. The structure of the project is based on the Application Package pattern.

Rename the main project and the root file of the application which in this case is flask_bolierplate

## Config
The root of the project has a config file. This contains all the config available locally for the application.

`app.config.from_object(Name_of_the_config_class)`
